// The eye fit (the "Eye fit" tab): where the targets are, how captured averages become the gaze zero point, the up gain
// and each eye's lid fit, and the step-by-step session the panel runs (with the dashboard open or closed).
// Five wears scored against the true dots (2026-10-09) showed that only the zero point measured fresh each wear carries
// over: Valve's sideways and down gains (0.73-1.30 down) and its tilt changed from wear to wear, and keeping them made
// the next wear worse than Valve's raw gaze (3.36° against 2.78° off), while the up gain stayed about the same (mean
// 0.88). So the whole fit writes the zero point, the mean up gain of the last kUpGainFits whole fits and the eyelids;
// sideways and down stay 1 and the tilt 0, and each wear only re-centers.
// Nothing here talks to OpenVR or writes files, so it can be tested on its own (gaze_fit_test.cpp).
